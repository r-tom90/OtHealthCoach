# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

Packages Used

- react-helmet-async
  Including the Helmet package is still beneficial for managing the meta tags in your React application, even though React itself does not provide built-in SEO features. While search engines can crawl and index JavaScript-rendered content, having well-defined meta tags can improve how your website appears in search engine results.

The Helmet package, such as react-helmet-async, provides a convenient way to dynamically update the meta tags of your web page based on the current content. It allows you to set the title, description, and other meta tags that are important for SEO.

By using Helmet, you can ensure that the appropriate meta tags are included in the HTML response sent to search engines and social media platforms when your website is shared or indexed. This helps search engines understand the content of your website and display relevant information in search results, which can improve your SEO.

So, while React itself does not directly handle SEO, using Helmet or similar packages allows you to manage and optimize the meta tags for better SEO

  CMS
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)

  - Sanity to manage the content and facilitate the download process. Here's a revised approach:

  - Upload and manage program details: Use Sanity to upload and manage the details of your digital programs, including the title, description, price, and any other relevant metadata. You can create a schema in Sanity to represent the program details.

  - Create a product listing: Use Sanity to create a product listing page or section on your website that displays the available programs for purchase. You can fetch the program details from Sanity and render them on your website.

  - Implement the purchase process: Integrate an e-commerce platform or payment gateway with your website to handle the purchase process. When a customer selects a program and proceeds to purchase, they can provide their payment details and complete the transaction.

  - Generate a download link: After a successful purchase, you can generate a unique and secure download link for the program. This link can be associated with the customer's purchase record or sent to them via email.

  - Provide access to the download: To allow customers to download the purchased program, you can provide the download link on a confirmation page or in an email notification. When the customer clicks the link, they can initiate the download of the program file.

  - Secure the download link: To ensure the security of the program file, you can implement measures such as expiring the download link after a certain period of time or a specific number of downloads. Additionally, you can use appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the download link.

  - By leveraging Sanity to manage program details and integrating an e-commerce platform for the purchase process, you can sell digital programs and provide customers with the ability to download them after purchase. Remember to implement appropriate security measures to protect the program files and ensure a smooth user experience.

Strapi: Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that provides a flexible and customizable way to manage content. With Strapi, you can create a schema to represent your digital programs and manage their details. You can then integrate an e-commerce solution or build custom functionality to handle the purchase and download process.
